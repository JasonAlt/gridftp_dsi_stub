# If "$ENV VAL" is not present in config at time of fork, child process
# will not have it, it is not inherited from the parent process.

# Module is loaded before client authenticates. Module start() is called
# after client supplies credentials. Missing symbol issues are obvious once
# start() is called.

# Parent GridFTP process does not make use of $LD_LIBRARY_PATH in its config
# to find modules, only the child process does. SO DON'T USE IT.

# Parent DSI search order:
#  - /usr/lib64
#  - /lib64
#  - /lib
#  - /usr/lib
#  - ld.so.conf

# Child DSI search order:
#  - /usr/lib64
#  - /lib64
#  - /lib
#  - /usr/lib
#  - $LD_LIBRARY_PATH in GridFTP config
#  - ld.so.conf
